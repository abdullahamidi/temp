# OpenFOAM&reg; Turbulence Technical Committee Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the OpenFOAM&reg; [Turbulence Technical Committee](https://wiki.openfoam.com/Turbulence_Technical_Committee) repository - a hub of collaboration and innovation for OpenFOAM&reg; users.

This repository is included with [OpenFOAM](https://www.openfoam.com/)&reg;
as a collection of nested [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

It hosts academic and industrial contributions in the realm of turbulence
modeling to cultivate a space for knowledge exchange, fostering collaboration
that propels the field and OpenFOAM&reg; forward.

Your ideas and insights are not just welcome â€“ they are the building blocks of a
community dedicated to advancing turbulence modeling in unison. Please consider
to join us.

## How to Contribute

### Two-Tier System

The repository follows the so-called the *two-tier system*, employing
the tags `Tier-0` and `Tier-1` in order to effortlessly welcome
community contributions.

The contributions designated as `Tier-0` are only promoted within this
repository, while the `Tier-1` contributions are integrated as a submodule.

The requirements for the *two-tier system* are as follows:

| Tier   | Requirements |
| ---    | ---          |
| Tier-0 | 1. Include a `README.md` file as a user guide.<br>2. Up-to-date contact details of the maintainer. |
| Tier-1 | 1. Tier-0 requirements. <br>2. Error-free compilation with the latest OpenFOAM&reg; version. <br>3. Minimum one reproducible tutorial.|

### Add Your Contributions

You can host your code in any Git-based source code repository
hosting service, e.g. Bitbucket or GitHub.

To add your contributions, simply follow the steps below by substituting
`<>`-enclosed texts (or adopting any other suitable method):

1. [Fork this repository, and clone the new repository if necessary](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/forking_workflow.html):

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/<user-name>/turbulence-community.git turbulence-community
```

2. [Add your repository as a submodule in a feature branch](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/feature_branch_workflow.html):

```bash
cd turbulence-community/
```
```bash
git switch -c <feature-branch-name>
```
```bash
git submodule add <remote-repo-url> <submodule-name>
```
```bash
git commit -m "ENH: <submodule-name>: add a new submodule"
```

3. [Push your feature branch to GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/push_options.html):

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin <feature-branch-name>
```

4. [Open a merge request targeting this repository after your internal tests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html).

## How to Use

1. **Source the OpenFOAM&reg; Repository:**

Assuming you have successfully acquired OpenFOAM&reg; by adhering to one of
the [Build Guides](https://develop.openfoam.com/Development/openfoam/-/wikis/building),
the first step is to source the OpenFOAM&reg; environment as follows:

```bash
source <installation path>/etc/bashrc
```

e.g. if installed under the `~/openfoam/OpenFOAM-v2312` directory:

```bash
source ~/openfoam/OpenFOAM-v2312/etc/bashrc
```

2. **Register and Update the Nested Submodules:**

On the first use, you need to register the submodules, and then update them.
You can execute both steps for all the nested submodules as follows while
you are at `$WM_PROJECT_DIR`:

```bash
cd $WM_PROJECT_DIR
```
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive modules/turbulence-community
```

Executing this single-line command prepares the turbulence community repository
for compilation. Note that other [submodules](https://develop.openfoam.com/Development/openfoam/-/wikis/modules)
available in OpenFOAM&reg; are excluded by explicitly specifying this
submodule's name at the end of the command.

3. **Compile the Nested Submodules:**

Configure and build OpenFOAM&reg; without submodules by
following one of the [Guides](https://develop.openfoam.com/Development/openfoam/-/wikis/home).

If OpenFOAM&reg; has already been built, you can also navigate into the `modules`
directory, and initiate the compilation using all available processors with the
following commands:

```bash
cd $WM_PROJECT_DIR/modules/
```
```bash
./Allwmake -j
```

4. **Remove the Nested Submodules:**

If you need to remove the submodules or wish to restart the process,
you can simply carry out the task as follows:

```bash
cd $WM_PROJECT_DIR
```
```bash
git submodule deinit -f modules/turbulence-community
```

This command deregisters the submodule and clears the
`modules/turbulence-community` directory.

To build the library "libtioga.so"
---------------------------------
[user@machine tioga]$ cd build
[user@machine tioga]$ cmake ..
[user@machine tioga]$ make

To run the test the case
---------------------------
[user@machine tioga]$ cd case;./run.sh 16

run.sh does two things:

1. builds a sample grid system that is composed of
   a prizmatic sphere grid and a background hex grid 
   The argument "16" above says how many cores you want
   to test this problem.

2. performs connectivity using tioga and verifies that
   the interpolation accuracy for a linear field

To run the accuracy test
-------------------------
[user@machine tioga]$ cd case; ../build/driver/poisson_mms.exe

Default option will check if 2nd order accuracy is obtained with
grid refinement for the 5-point Laplacian using method of manufactured 
solutions (MMS)
